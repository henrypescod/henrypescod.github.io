            Through a data-driven analysis of 740 million appointments over 18 months, the NHS aimed to understand missed GP appointments and resource utilisation. Using Python for exploratory analysis and visualisation, I examined resource capacity, staffing, and trends in X (formerly Twitter) engagement. Key insights revealed that missed appointments were not due to capacity issues, same-day appointments were missed less often than those with longer waiting periods, and telephone appointments had a lower no-show rate compared to face-to-face visits. Recommendations included increasing telephone and online appointments, improving reminders for longer waiting periods, and enhancing X engagement by leveraging popular healthcare hashtags like #ai.
