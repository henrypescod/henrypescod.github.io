                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Naturally curious and observant. Thrives on new challenges and never stops seeking out learning opportunities and sharing knowledge.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy solving problems with data, whether that is a personal problem, like creating [INSERT PROJECT] or on the job, using data to create better actionable insights.</p>
                    <p>I recently completed a leadership programme in the charity sector, which led me to programme managing Challenge Prizes for the UK Social Innovation charity Nesta. [INSET EXAMPLES OF WORK CARRIED OUT].</p>
                    <p>I returned to analytics in 2024, after running my own business (which included some data analysis) 5 years. I’ve always loved math and logic, and I draw on my previous experience when communicating the complex messages I find in data.</p>
                    <p>I’m currently completing a Data Analytics accelerator course at the London School Economics, and mentoring impact professionals on the career change leadership programme On Purpose.</p>
