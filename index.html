              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">  
                When I was 35, I did what every middle-aged man dreams of (or so the saying goes)—I opened my own bar. 
                A friend and I brewed our own beer, built a brand, and launched a pub in South East London. Over the 
                next six years, we brewed multiple beers, employed 36 staff, and generated over £1 million in revenue. 
                The pub served its final pint at the end of June 2024, marking the end of a memorable chapter. 
                But what has all this got to do with me wanting to be a data analyst? The experience taught me a lot, 
                but there are three key reasons why it led me here.

              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
              Running a bar isn't just about serving drinks; it's about making decisions based on the data in front of you. I found myself drawn to the analytical tasks more than any other part of the business. 
	      For example:
	      </p>
              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">  
	      <ul>
		      <li>I used our point-of-sale data to track beer wastage, figure out which beers to brew most often, and plan brewing schedules to meet demand.</li>
		      <li> I analysed our banking data to find cost-saving opportunities, like switching point-of-sale providers and banks, which helped keep us in the black.</li>
             	      </li> I dug into our bookkeeping data to explore business changes, such as opening and closing the kitchen based on profitability.</li>
  	      <ul>
              </p>

              <p class="text-base paragraph">
              These experiences showed me that my real passion lies in analysing data and making data-driven decisions, not just in the bar but beyond it. 
              That’s why I decided to focus on a career in data analytics, where I can do just that in a more defined role.

              <p class="text-base paragraph">
              Now, a bit of context. The bar was actually a side project. While running it, I continued my career as a programme manager. 
              Up to this point, I had a varied career as a negotiator, numbers guy, and project manager. I sold office buildings, 
              created financial models for property investors, and even built a hotel out of shipping containers. 
              But I’ve always been curious, and I had an itch to try something new. Opening the bar scratched that itch—I proved I could 
              build something from scratch. But now, I’m ready for a new challenge. I want to learn, develop, and master something bigger, 
              and that’s where data analytics comes in.

              <p class="text-base paragraph">
                Running a bar, especially during tough times like the COVID-19 lockdowns, threw plenty of problems my way. 
                When we faced a cash flow crisis during the first lockdown, I came up with a plan to raise funds by 
                selling membership packages and pre-selling beer. We raised £13k, sold all our stock, and managed to keep 
                the business going until we could reopen. This experience reinforced my knack for problem-solving, a skill that’s 
                just as crucial in data analytics when you’re faced with complex challenges and tight resources.
