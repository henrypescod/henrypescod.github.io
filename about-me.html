                What I Learned as a Small Business Owner
              </h2>
              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">  
                In 2018, I did what every middle-aged man supposedly dreams of—I opened my own pub. A friend and I brewed beer, built a brand, and launched a bar in South East London. Over six years, we brewed multiple beers, employed 36 staff, and generated over £1 million in revenue. At the end of June 2024, we served our final pint and closed the doors on what had been an unforgettable chapter. 
                Even though I never gave up my day job, running the pub had a huge impact on me. It taught me more than I ever expected and confirmed a few things I already knew:

                Curiosity and the Drive to Learn
              </h2>
              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
                I’ve always been curious about how things work. After 10 years as an analyst in the property sector, I wanted to get hands-on experience in running a business. At Camden Market, I worked with over 280 small businesses, which gave me a close-up view of their challenges and successes. Later, I helped develop a hotel business made from shipping containers in Waterloo. But opening my own pub was something else entirely—it was my chance to prove I could build something from scratch.
                <p>
                    <p class="text-base paragraph">
                       And I did. In three weeks, I designed the bar and project-managed the conversion of a 1930s warehouse. I hired a team, set up systems, and even built a data pipeline so I could regularly track how the business was performing. On top of that, I threw myself into marketing—creating websites, managing social media, and hosting events (43 in the first year alone). It was a rush, and seeing friends enjoy what we’d created made it all worthwhile.
                      </p>
                   <br>
                    <p class="text-base paragraph">       
                      But over time, I realised that the day-to-day running of the business wasn’t enough for me. I missed learning new things and solving new problems. That’s when I started thinking about where my real passion lies—and it brought me back to data.

                      My Love for Data
                      </h2>
                      <p class="text-base paragraph">
                        It turns out running a pub isn’t just about pouring pints. The part I loved most was digging into the data and using it to make better decisions. For example:
                      </p>
                    </div>              
              </p>
              <ul class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
                <li>Tracking Trends: I used our point-of-sale system to monitor beer wastage, creating weekly reports in Excel. Those insights helped us order smarter, cutting waste and boosting profits.
                <li>Cutting Costs: By analysing our banking data, I found cheaper providers for our POS system and business bank account. Switching saved us thousands over the years.</li>
                <li>Streamlining Operations: I crunched the numbers on our kitchen’s performance and figured out the best times to open and close it to maximise profitability.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
                Those experiences made one thing clear: I love using data to solve problems and uncover opportunities. That’s the kind of work I want to focus on full-time—helping businesses use their data to make smarter decisions.

                Problem-Solving Under Pressure
              </h2>
              <p class="text-base paragraph">
                Of course, running a bar wasn’t all spreadsheets and beer festivals. When COVID-19 hit, we were thrown into a cash flow crisis like so many others. To stay afloat, I came up with a plan to sell membership packages and pre-sell beer. It worked—we raised £13,000, which helped us reopen, pay our core staff, and clear our stock.
              </p>
            </div>
              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
                      That’s just one example of how running a small business pushed me to think creatively and act quickly. Problem-solving became second nature, and I know that skill will serve me just as well in the world of data analytics.

                      Running the pub taught me a lot, but most importantly, it helped me figure out what I really want to do: work with data, solve problems, and keep learning.
