                From Crafting Beers to Crafting Insights: My Journey to Data Analytics

              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">  
                In 2018, I did what every middle-aged man dreams of (or so the saying goes) — I opened my own bar. 
                A friend and I brewed our own beer, built a brand, and launched a pub in South East London. Over the 
                next six years, we brewed multiple beers, employed 36 staff, and generated over £1 million in revenue. 
                The pub served its final pint at the end of June 2024, marking the end of a memorable chapter. 
                But what has all this got to do with me wanting to be a data analyst? The experience taught me a lot, 
                but there are three key reasons why it led me here:

              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
                Running a bar isn't just about serving drinks; it's about making smart decisions based on the data you have. I found myself drawn to the analytical side of the business more than any other. 
                For example:
              </p>
              <ul class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
                <li>I used our point-of-sale system to track beer wastage, creating weekly reports in Excel that helped us identify trends and adjust our ordering accordingly. This helped us minimise waste and maximise profits.</li>
                <li>I also analysed our banking data to find cost-saving opportunities. By carefully comparing different providers, I was able to switch our point-of-sale system and our business bank, which helped us stay in the black.</li>
                <li>I even dug into our bookkeeping data to explore potential business changes. For instance, by analysing the profitability of our kitchen, I could make data-driven decisions about when to open and close it to maximise efficiency.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-base paragraph margin-bottom-20">
                These experiences showed me that my real passion lies in analysing data and using it to make informed decisions. I'm eager to apply this passion to a dedicated data analytics role, where I can make a real impact in a dynamic and challenging field.

              <p class="text-base paragraph">
                Now, a bit of context. The bar was actually a side project. While running it, I continued my career as an analyst and project manager. Juggling the two side by side definitely honed my time management and multitasking skills! Up to this point, I had various roles in the property industry – I sold office buildings in the City, created financial models for Camden Market, and built a hotel out of shipping containers in Waterloo. But I've always been curious and had an itch to try something new. Opening the bar scratched that itch – I proved I could build a successful business from scratch. But now, I'm ready for a new challenge. I'm excited by the possibilities within data analytics, particularly how machine learning can be used to optimise business processes and drive innovation.

              <p class="text-base paragraph">
                Running a bar, especially during tough times like the COVID-19 lockdowns, threw plenty of problems my way. When we faced a cash flow crisis during the first lockdown, I came up with a plan to raise funds by selling membership packages and pre-selling beer. This initiative was a success: we raised £13k, which covered the cost of reopening and allowed us to keep our core team employed. We even managed to sell all of our existing stock! This experience solidified my knack for problem-solving, a skill that’s just as crucial in data analytics when you’re faced with complex challenges.
